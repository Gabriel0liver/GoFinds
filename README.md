GoFinds is an app meant to be used for those moments where you are in a foreign city and want to know the name and history of a landmark. With GoFinds you can just take a picture of a landmark and you will get the name and the history of the given landmark. GoFinds also has a feature where you can check out the landmarks other users have travelled to by looking at their uploads in an instagram type of way.
